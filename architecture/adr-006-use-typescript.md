# Use Typescript for typing in the React frontend

## Status

Proposed

## Context

Being able to guarantee the type of the return value of a function, or a functions incoming parameters 
removes an entire class of bugs caused through misunderstanding or refactors that touch more than was expected.

## Decision

Add TypeScript library with expectation that we will add ts to our current code and use it in all work going forward.

## Consequences

- Better IDE support 
- Clarity around what can be done with a particular object
- Learning how to use typescript and incorporate it in daily work
- Need to add typescript to current code
